# HL7Swift

HL7Swift is a minimal implementation of the HL7 2.x standard written in Swift. It provides a few tools to parse, send and receive HL7 pipe delimited messages with ease. 

## Disclaimer

HL7Swift is *not* a production ready library and is not intented to be used as such. It focuses on the computing aspects of the HL7 standard, and provides a powerful set of tools to deal with HL7 messages at the atomic level. The authors of this source code cannot be held responsible for its misuses or malfunctions, as it is defined in the license below.

## Dependencies

* **SwiftNIO**: [https://github.com/apple/swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
* **Swift Argument Parser** : [https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser)

## Features

- Parse HL7 message (v2.x)
- Send HL7 messages over TCP/IP (HL7 client)
- Receive HL7 messages over TCP/IP (HL7 server)

## TODO

- Documentation
- Message validation
- Handle exceptions
- Pretty print message with groups
- Convert to XML
- Read message with the correct encoding
- Enum for message type ? (YES!)

## Getting Started

_TBD_
